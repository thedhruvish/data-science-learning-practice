# 5. Can you write a program that determines the nature of a given number (in this case, 87) as being 
# positive, negative, or zero? The program should be designed to take the number as input and 
# perform the necessary calculations to determine if the number is positive (i.e., greater than zero), 
# negative (i.e., less than zero), or zero (i.e., equal to zero). The output of the program should indicate 
# which of these three categories the given number falls into.

num = int(input("Enter of N:"))
if num > 0:
    print(f"{num} is positive.")
elif num < 0:
    print(f"{num} is negative.")
else:
    print(f"{num} is zero.")
