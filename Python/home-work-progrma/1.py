# Q1. Write a Python program that defines a function called "add_numbers" that takes two arguments 
# (i.e., numbers) and returns their sum. Within the function, add the two numbers together and return 
# the result using the return statement. Call the function with the values 5 and 6, and print out the 
# returned result. This will result in the addition of 5 and 6, with the output of the program being the 
# sum of these two numbers. 


def add_numbers(a, b):
    sum = a + b
    return sum

add = add_numbers(5, 6)

print("The Sum :", add)
