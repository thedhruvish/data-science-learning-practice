# Q2. Write a Python program that calculates the square root of a given number using a built-in 
# function. Specifically, the program should take an integer or float input from the user, calculate its 
# square root using the 'sqrt()' function from the 'math' module, and print out the result to the user. 
# As an example, calculate the square root of the number 625 using this program, which should output 
# the value of 25. 
# import math 


import math
num = float(input("Enter Number: "))
print(f"The square root of {num} is:{math.sqrt(num)}")
